## Description

This document describes how to start our "FourForOneStockPredictor" App, which is an improved version of our original "StockPrediction" app released for a course project of Shenglan and Xiaoying. 

First, clean and install our package. You can so do by running "Clean and Install" at the "Build" session if you are using Rstudio.

Second, execute our shiny app through the following commands:

```{r}
library(FourForOneStockPredictor)
run_app()
```
